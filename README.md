# Cache With Time Limit in C++

I wanted to implement [the Cache With Time Limit](https://leetcode.com/problems/cache-with-time-limit/description/) leetcode problem in C++, but for some reason it doesn't have C++ as an option on leetcode, so figured I would just implement it myself here.

Granted, I will not have access to the full test cases, but I think I can come up with enough that I can validate it myself.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.14 or higher
- C/C++ Compiler 
    - I'm using msvc 14 installed with Visual Studio 2022

### Compilation
To compile the project, follow these steps:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Running the Test Suite
Once the project is compiled, you can run the test suite using:
```
./tests/Debug/unit_tests.exe
```
